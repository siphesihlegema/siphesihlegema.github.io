    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Siphesihle Gema, a Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science student at the University of Cape Town. I’m passionate about using technology and data to solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact in South Africa and beyond.</p>

<p>I currently serve as Vice Chair of the UCT Quantum Computing Society, where I help introduce students to the exciting field of quantum computing. I’m particularly interested in exploring the intersection of AI, machine learning, and quantum technologies.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning by building and applying my knowledge to practical projects. I have participated in hackathons where I collaborated on innovative, data-driven solutions, and I have built a linear regression model from scratch, which strengthened my understanding of machine learning fundamentals.</p>

<p>I am motivated by the idea of creating impactful solutions through research, projects, and future entrepreneurial ventures. I am always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and share ideas that drive learning, growth, and innovation.</p>
